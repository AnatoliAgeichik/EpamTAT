Friday night and I'm ridin' solo (Yeah)
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low (It's lit!)
I don't mess with your energy (Nah), no photos (Ayy)
So antisocial, but I don't care (Ayy)
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here (Ayy, pop it)
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though (Ayy, pop it, pop it)
Got my hat low, don't talk to me (Straight up!)

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Travis Scott]
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Travis Scott]
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night (Straight up)
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
